Description: Reconstruct pedigrees from genotype data, by optimising the likelihood 
    over all possible pedigrees subject to given restrictions. Tailor-made plots
    facilitate evaluation of the output. This package is part of the 'ped suite'
    ecosystem for pedigree analysis. In particular, it imports 'pedprobr' for 
    calculating pedigree likelihoods and 'forrel' for estimating pairwise relatedness.
