Description: Reconstruct small and medium-sized pedigrees from genotype data. The 
    optimisation works by generating a list of all possible pedigrees subject to 
    various restrictions, and comparing the likelihoods of these. Tailor-made plots
    facilitate evaluation of the output. This package is part of the 'ped suite'
    ecosystem for pedigree analysis in R. In particular, it imports 'pedprobr'
    for calculating pedigree likelihoods and 'forrel' for estimating pairwise
    relatedness.
